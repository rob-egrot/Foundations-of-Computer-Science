# Foundations-of-Computer-Science
These are notes and assorted supporting files (slides etc.) for my part of the course on the foundations of computer science given to first year grad students at 
Mahidol university. Incoming grad students here do not usually have a strong theory background, so this course catches up on the basic of Turing machines, decidability, 
NP-completeness etc. The approach is intended to be fairly rigourous, but also friendly to relative beginners. Students are expected to have already taken the 531 
Mathematics for CS course (see another of my repositories), as particurlaly the materil on logic is important here. 

Files are written in LaTex, and potential editors are warned that this document has been built up over several years and I have not always followed best practices.

The main file can be found in the notes/combined folder. This includes exercies and also an appendix containing solutions. To create a document without solutions just
comment out or delete the relevant part at the end of the .tex file.

Stand-alone exercise sheets can also be created, but to get this to work properly you may need to make some edits (e.g. some references will need to be manually edited).
